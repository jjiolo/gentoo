ipv6 sucks...

anything you talk to gets a routable ipv6 address to probe for listeners
anything listening inbetween gets a list of routable address to scan

slaac mac addresses allow tracking devices
implies bruteforce range of all global address
cant exactly search for devices ?

can check if a device is currently located at known public wifi spots or v6 ranges

bob goes here here and here scan bobs mac address against all local ipv6 addresses
address pool for city / town against target mac is viable provided you can get the list

 public wifi with ipv6 and routing enabled would expose addresses < - easy to trigger and add to wardriving maps
*public wifi with icmp6 and ping enabled would expose addresses < - current reality

 reduces the pool of people capable of masscanning the internet < - in a way ?
 then totally increases the ability for normie level stalking devices and targets across an entire city ?
 implementing reverse scans from services becomes viable to sell as metadata ?
 everything that gets verified v6 address can scan services and reverse scan the internet ?

everyone keeps claiming trickle down technology
if god mode scanning is voice fingerprinting people over google now cortana amazon echo and countless always on microphones
pleb mode is now definintly nearly the same level of tracking as telecomms providers get over nothing but wifi : /

dev mode hosting a quick 0.0.0.0 instead of a 127.0.0.1 poof public visable service
^ seen forum posts on people scanning vpns and getting all sorts of stupid now public facing web servers

 logic would imply ipv4 for aslong as possible to reduce exposure
 allowing ipv6 with a ddns or reverse tcp tracker allows roaming routable addresses

 v4 outbound normal traffic
 v6 listening and established replies only


isps get lists of mac addresses for name registered to router
cross correlate mac based on time at residence to create location / contact information and live tracking
^ if you mesh isp wifi routers you can already do real time tracking of wifi mac addresses directly to google maps

might not be able to masscan the entire v6 range can definintly do some stalker level creepy functionality at pleb level

 if ipv6 attempts to become some magical static addressing for the masses
 static addresses and allowing contact lists creates viable key exchange without a third party because isp have just replaced them
 botnets no longer need to depend on reverse tcp connections or upnpd

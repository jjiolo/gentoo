monero client terminology...

            account < - split multiple references to balance
            address < - multiple addresses per account increases privacy (requires access to private view key)
 integrated-address < - multiple addresses based on random payment ID (allows identifying incoming transactions) (requires no access to private view key)

 show_transfers should list integreated-address payment id ? (couldnt prove it)
 payments <payment_id> < - lists all payments with that id address

#############

 proving a payment...

  show_transfers < - grab the txid of the payment
  get_tx_key <txid> < - send txid and output to the person your verifying the payment with

18080 - p2pd - syncs the block chain
18081 - apid - trusted port connect wallets to it
18089 - apid - restricted port connect wallets to it
               (wont allow changing mining wallet or start/stop mining)
#############

p2pd traffic is not proxied (syncing the blockchain)

 can derive from traffic which blocks were solved by monitoring unsynced blocks

 all tx traffic can be forwarded over tor

 trusted wallet rpc can be hosted over unix socket or localhost
 restricted wallet rpc can be hosted over normie net or tor hidden service

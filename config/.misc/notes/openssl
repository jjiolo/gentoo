openssl client

 log every request and fingerprint every certificate in the chain

 eg. curl https://domain.tld - > domain.tld:fp0:fp1:fp2:
     openssh known_hosts tofu style

worst case...

 client accepts all valid certificates regardless of the fingerprint chain
 only display changes to fingerprints related to the domain

best case...

 client alerts on all changes to the domains fingerprint chain
 and forces the user to verify proceeding

either way...

 allows building up a profile of domains and their compitency
 allows building up a profile on certificate providers and their compitency

examples...

every domain you have ever visted suddenly starts using the same certificate authority
 someones using a popped ca to dynamically sign every requests you made

single domain keeps flipping the fingerprint chain
 cant be trusted to protect their own private keys

lowest point in the chains fingerprint keeps flipping
 probably roaming and hitting geo based round robin or anycast

fingerprint changes every 4 months
 someone using an automated lets encrypt setup

^ still implies generating as much historical information as possible to predict future actions

^ sharing this data globally (proofs in the maths it cant be spoofed)
  allows painting a larger picture of the current environment

#############

cert revoke

revoke server needs the ability to lookup individual certificates
revoke server needs the ability for cert providers to request timestamps

removes the need for clients to ddos the revoke server allowing the providers to distrbute validity periods

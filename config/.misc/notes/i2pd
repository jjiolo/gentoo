 really bad first implementation

 ntcp2 segfaulting...

 tor syslog output 100%

 ./does_this_work_yet - addressbook/addresses.csv takes ages, less from persistence
                        trying vanity.i2p domains (fails)
                        trying .b32.i2p domains implies etc/sites.eep

 (enabled webconsole - creation success rate && client tunnels: XX)

 doesnt survive disconnects...

 tor started coming back eventually, sometimes

 net.ipv4.ip_unprivileged_port_start ; sleep 1 doesnt work (on the first attempt only)

 -------------

 ! ${services}/i2pd/destinations/<address.b32.i2p> !
 ^ creates the address name for tunnels.conf...
 ? single key - implies same address to multiple ports...
 ? multiple key - address per port...

 [i2pd]

* requires -/+ 60 second ntp sync... (tor had -/+ 5 minutes)

* connects to reseed servers (hardcoded in the binary)

* pulls initial list of peers and updates netDB

* 

-------------
* good tunnel creation success rate 15 - 40 % (larger is better) (127.0.0.1:7070)

#############

high level config ?

        [http] false (not really useful)
   [httpproxy] true (does i2pd and normie net)
  [socksproxy] true (doesnt i2pd and normie net) (can i2pd or forward to SOCKSPort)
         [sam] false (local proxy port for applications?)
         [bob] false (deprecated for sam)
        [i2cp] false (local proxy port for applications?)
  [i2pcontrol] false (same as tor controlPort?)
        [upnp] false (compiles without it less attack surface)
 [addressbook] true (allows vanity names sharing addressbook/addresses.csv as a hosts file)
       [ntcp2] false (authenticated key agreement protocol, causes segfaults...)
        [ssu2] false (resistance to censorship and identification, forces listening on 0.0.0.0:1 ?)

 [floodfill.router.info]

 bootstrapping without reseed servers...

 reseed servers - used to fill netDB with initial peers

 in case default reseed servers are blocked

 obtain router.info file out of band

 i2pd --reseed.floodfill=/path/to/router.info

the bad...

 busybox setpriv doesnt work, (build.initramfs work around over a clean install)

 implementation is bloated, doesnt integrate with the whole very well

the good...

 util-linux +caps does work

 allows privdropping services indefinintly

 to large a security benifit to ignore

[setpriv]
-------------
 * not using it to allow none root access, using it to restrict scope of compromise when executed by root
 * wont set cwd
 * wont clear environment
 * --reset-env - HOME SHELL USER LOGNAME PATH (PATH is currently wrong, set at compile time)
-------------
 * etc/init - updated udhcpd and ntpd init
 * etc/self/a.chroot/build.initramfs - added setpriv
 * etc/self/setpriv/setpriv_{udhcpd,ntpd,udhcpc,ntpc,sshd,crond}

 - find a toggle to optionally...
    prevent process from spawning capability granted processes
    allow process to spawn capability granted processes

 setpriv -
  inheritable capabilities - set on recieving process to prevent parent over sharing ? 
      ambient capabilities - preserved across execve (inherited by new processes ?)
  capability bounding set  - restrict capabilities process may recieve (-all prevent inheritable or ambient capabilities being set)

  setcap -   permitted - automatically permitted ?
           inheritable -
             effective - if set permitted raised into effective

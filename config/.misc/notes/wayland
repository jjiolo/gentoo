fuck that shit would be an understatement

 triples build time

 forces gcc/rust/llvm to hit radeonsi_dri.so...

-------------

everythings hard before you know how to do it

reversing the smallest package list to get software rendering functional

is probably doable ?

not realistic for this project

massive increase to build time

massive increase to complexity

might get bored and finish it one day

-------------

#############

 suid seatd-launch sway + input,audio,video + su -lc 'exec terminal' nobody
 ^ minimum viable product

 if whatever alpines using for virtio_gpu_dri is viable on metal without being utterly shit
 it would reduce complexity levels back to viable

#############

* wayland/sway testing - build order creates empty packages... (not that it works regardless)
^ /usr/lib64/dri/radeonsi_dri.so breaks startx
  delete it and old setup works
  leave it and XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp seatd-launch sway sort of works

#############

tl;dr

* massively simplifies the idea of desktop dac isolation ?
  dont need to wrap Xephyr to anything when it can just run natively

^ that alone is enough complexity reduction to justify it given @set logic
  till you figure out your nesting into Xwayland which is literally Xephyr to support half the shit to begin with
  making what already exists twice as complicated for no reason

-------------

addgroup user input && chmod -R 0755 /run/udev && XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp seatd-launch sway < - currently works

alacritty broke ?

radeonsi_dri bricked sway in qemu
radeonsi_dri bricked startx

seatd-launch < - suid blob that only controls /dev/tty permissions
                 no idea /shrug set them statically at runtime and delete the lot of it ?
                 (newer sway forced seatd as a dependency)

xorg executes libudev to get hardware devices
sway reads the udev file cache to get hardware devices
^ /proc /sys permissions are all global any user can generate /run/udev locking 0700 does nothing
  would need grsecs permissions patch set to harden udev literally does fuck all but parse shit output into readable
^ or its suid and xorg is reading it regardless over just executing it and not needing the shitty daemon in the first place
  imo libudev stripped to only parse system input output added to display server > depending on a system daemon

-------------
adding llvm fucked an obsurd amount of binaries with segfaults
-------------

#############

sway -suid with audio,video,input works...
su -ls/bin/sh -c 'XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-1 exec alacritty' nobody
^ Xwayland ?
^ kwin_wayland XDG_RUNTIME_DIR=/tmp WAYLAND_DISPLAY=wayland-{1,2,3}
  should be able to nest sway single ebuild and config files for hotkeying host/guest ?

#############

cheating /dev/dri /dev/input /run/udev permissions (to mimic input,audio,video groups)
ash /etc/toor

fairly sure - /usr/lib64/dri/<binaries>
-Ddri_drivers [auto,i915,i965,r100,r200,nouveau] not used ?
-Dgallium-drivers=virgl,swrast ? virtio drivers ?
-Dvulkan-drivers=amd ?
^ mesa just forced USE= which indirectly forces setting VIDEO_CARD...
